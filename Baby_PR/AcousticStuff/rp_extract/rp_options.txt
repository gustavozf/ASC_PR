;RP_EXTRACT Options file
;for Rhythm Patterns Audio feature extraction V 0.64 and above
;comments start with ; or %
;sections [dirs] and [opts] are important to distinguish options

[dirs]			  ;directory names
;filenames provided via filelist to RP_EXTRACT are relative to input_basedir
input_basedir=/home/user/collections/

;output files will be created here
output=/home/lidy/collections/newrpcode

;all output files will be named starting with projectname
projectname=test

;binpath should be set to the path where helper applications like lame mpeg decoder can be found
;if omitted, default search path will be used
;NOTE: in the current version of rp_extract this option is not used!
binpath=

;filelistfile is a pointer to an Ascii file listing all audio files to extract, relative to input_basedir
;use absolute path for filelistfile!
;NOTE: is only used when optionsfile is the only argument to RP_EXTRACT
